## Question

### A phone number, such as (212) 767-8900, can be thought of as having three parts: the 
area code (212), the exchange (767), and the number (8900). Write a program that uses a
structure to store these three parts of a phone number separately. Call the structure
phone. Create two structure variables of type phone. Initialize one, and have the user
input a number for the other one. Then display both numbers. The interchange might
look like this:
```C++
Enter your area code, exchange, and number: 415 555 1212
My number is (212) 767-8900
Your number is (415) 555-1212
```

### Program:

```C++
/**************************************************|
/****************** OOP Programming ***************|
***************************************************/
// uses structure to store phone number


#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

struct phone
{
    int area;  //area code
    int exchange;  // exchange
    int number;   //number
};

int main()
{
    phone ph1 ={ 212, 767, 8900}; //initialize phone number
    phone ph2; // define pphone number

    // get phone number from user

    cout<<"\n Enter your area code, exchange, and number";
    cout<<"\n(Don't use leading zeros) : ";
    cin>>ph2.area>>ph2.exchange>>ph2.number;
    cout<<"\n My number is"<<"("<<ph1.area<<")"<<"-"<<ph1.exchange<<"-"<<ph1.number;       //display number 
    cout<<"\n Your number is "<<"("<<ph2.area<<")"<<"-"<<ph2.exchange<<"-"<<ph2.number<<endl;

    return 0;
}

```
