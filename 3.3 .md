## question :

### Operators such as >>, which read input from the keyboard, must be able to convert a series of digits into a number. Write a program that does the same thing. It should allow the user to type up to six digits, and then display the resulting number as a type long integer. The digits should be read individually, as characters, using getche(). Constructing the number involves multiplying the existing value by 10 and then adding the new digit. (Hint: Subtract 48 or ‘0’ to go from ASCII to a numerical digit.)

```C++
Here’s some sample interaction: 
            Enter a number: 123456 
            Number is: 123456
```            


#### program :

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <conio.h>  //for getchar

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    unsigned long num=0;
    char ch;
    
    cout<<"Enter a number : ";
    cin>>num;
    
    while ((ch = _getche()) != '\r')    //quit on Enter
            num = num* 10 + ch - '0';
            cout<<"Number is : "<<num;
    
    
    return 0;
    
}
```
