## question :

### Operators such as >>, which read input from the keyboard, must be able to convert a series of digits into a number. Write a program that does the same thing. It should allow the user to type up to six digits, and then display the resulting number as a type long integer. The digits should be read individually, as characters, using getche(). Constructing the number involves multiplying the existing value by 10 and then adding the new digit. (Hint: Subtract 48 or ‘0’ to go from ASCII to a numerical digit.)

```C++
Here’s some sample interaction: 
            Enter a number: 123456 
            Number is: 123456
```            


#### program :

```C++

```
