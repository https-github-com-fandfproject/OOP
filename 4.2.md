## Question:

### A point on the two-dimensional plane can be represented by two numbers: an x coordinate and a y coordinate. For example, (4,5) represents a point 4 units to the right of the
vertical axis, and 5 units up from the horizontal axis. The sum of two points can be
defined as a new point whose x coordinate is the sum of the x coordinates of the two
points, and whose y coordinate is the sum of the y coordinates.
Write a program that uses a structure called point to model a point. Define three points,
and have the user input values to two of them. Then set the third point equal to the sum
of the other two, and display the value of the new point. Interaction with the program
might look like this:

```C++
Enter coordinates for p1: 3 4
Enter coordinates for p2: 5 7
Coordinates of p1+p2 are: 8, 11

```

### Program:

```C++
/**************************************************|
/****************** OOP Programming ***************|
***************************************************/
//structure models point on the plane

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

struct point
{
	int xCo;		//X coordinate
	int yCo;		//Y coordinate
};

int main()
{
	point p1, p2, p3;		//define 3 points
	
	cout << "\n Enter corrdinates for P1 : ";		//get 2 points
	cin >> p1.yCo >> p2.xCo;		//from user
	cout << "Enter coordinTES FOR P2 : ";
	cin >> p2.xCo >> p2.yCo;
	
	p3.xCo = p1.xCo + p2.xCo;		//find sum of p1 and p2
	p3.yCo = p1.yCo + p2.yCo;
	
	cout << "Coordinates of p1 + p2 are : " << p3.xCo << "," << p3.yCo << endl;		//display the sum
	
	return 0;
}
```
